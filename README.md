## Overview
<!-- ![overall_structure](./assets/fig_teaser.jpg) -->
<img src="./assets/fig_teaser.jpg" width="100%">

We propose **Collaborative Diffusion**, where users can use multiple modalities to control face generation and editing.
    *(a) Face Generation*. Given multi-modal controls, our framework synthesizes high-quality images consistent with the input conditions.
    *(b) Face Editing*. Collaborative Diffusion also supports multi-modal editing of real images with promising identity preservation capability.

<img src="./assets/fig_framework.jpg" width="100%">

We use pre-trained uni-modal diffusion models to perform multi-modal guided face generation and editing. At each step of the reverse process (i.e., from timestep t to t − 1), the **dynamic diffuser** predicts the spatial-varying and temporal-varying **influence function** to *selectively enhance or suppress the contributions of the given modality*.

## Installation

1. Clone repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ziqihuangg/Collaborative-Diffusion
   cd Collaborative-Diffusion
   ```

2. Create conda environment.<br>
If you already have an `ldm` environment installed according to [LDM](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion#requirements), you do not need to go throught this step (i.e., step 2). You can simply `conda activate codiff` and jump to step 3.

   ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    conda activate codiff
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
    pip install transformers==4.19.2 scann kornia==0.6.4 torchmetrics==0.6.0
    conda install -c anaconda git
    pip install git+https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops.git
   ```

## Download

### Download Checkpoints

1. Download the pre-trained models from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13MdDea8eI8P4ygeIyfy8krlTb8Ty0mAP?usp=sharing).

2. Put the models under `pretrained` as follows:
    ```
    Collaborative-Diffusion

        └── 512_vae.ckpt
    ```
### Download Datasets
We provide preprocessed data used in this project (see Acknowledgement for data source). You need download them only if you want to reproduce the training of Collaborative Diffusion. You can skip this step if you simply want to use our pre-trained models for inference.

1. Download the preprocessed training data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rLcdN-VctJpW4k9AfSXWk0kqxh329xc4?usp=sharing).

2. Put the datasets under `dataset` as follows:
    ```
    Collaborative-Diffusion
    └── dataset
        ├── image
        |   └──image_512_downsampled_from_hq_1024

    ```

## Generation
You can control face generation using text and segmentation mask.
1. `mask_path` is the path to the segmentation mask, and `input_text` is the text condition.

    ```bash
    python generate_512.py \
    --mask_path test_data/512_masks/27007.png \
    --input_text "This man has beard of medium length. He is in his thirties."
    ```
    ```bash
    python generate_512.py \
    --mask_path test_data/512_masks/29980.png \
    --input_text "This woman is in her forties."
    ```

2. You can view different types of intermediate outputs by setting the flags as `1`. For example,  to view the *influence functions*, you can set `return_influence_function` to `1`.

    ```bash
    python generate_512.py \
    --mask_path test_data/512_masks/27007.png \
    --input_text "This man has beard of medium length. He is in his thirties." \
    --ddim_steps 10 \
    --batch_size 1 \
    --save_z 1 \
    --return_influence_function 1 \
    --display_x_inter 1 \
    --save_mixed 1
    ```
    Note that producing intermediate results might consume a lot of GPU memory, so we suggest setting `batch_size` to `1`, and setting `ddim_steps` to a smaller value (e.g., `10`) to save memory and computation time.

## Training


We provide the entire training pipeline, including training the VAE, uni-modal diffusion models, and our proposed dynamic diffusers.

If you are only interested in training dynamic diffusers, you can use our provided checkpoints for VAE and uni-modal diffusion models. Simply skip step 1 and 2 and directly look at step 3.

1. **Train VAE.**

    LDM compresses images to the VAE latents to save computational cost, and later train UNet diffusion models on the VAE latents. This step is to reproduce the `pretrained/512_vae.ckpt`.

    ```bash
    python main.py \
    --logdir 'outputs/512_vae' \
    --base 'configs/512_vae.yaml' \
    -t  --gpus 0,1,2,3,
    ```

2. **Train the uni-modal diffusion models.**

    (1) train text-to-image model. This step is to reproduce the `pretrained/512_text.ckpt`.
    ```bash
    python main.py \
    --logdir 'outputs/512_text' \
    --base 'configs/512_text.yaml' \
    -t  --gpus 0,1,2,3,
    ```
    (2) train mask-to-image model. This step is to reproduce the `pretrained/512_mask.ckpt`.
    ```bash
    python main.py \
    --logdir 'outputs/512_mask' \
    --base 'configs/512_mask.yaml' \
    -t  --gpus 0,1,2,3,
    ```


3. **Train the dynamic diffusers.**

    The dynamic diffusers are the meta-networks that determine how the uni-modal diffusion models collaborate together. This step is to reproduce the `pretrained/512_codiff_mask_text.ckpt`.
    ```bash
    python main.py \
    --logdir 'outputs/512_codiff_mask_text' \
    --base 'configs/512_codiff_mask_text.yaml' \
    -t  --gpus 0,1,2,3,
    ```
